# Mars Rover Kata

## Mars Rover Kata using TDD and C#

As part of the Tech Returners training Programme, I am learning and utilising the skills of Test Driven Development and C# for the Mars Rover Kata. The extension of this project is also being used to help my peers to learn and develop their pair programming and TDD knowledge.

## Setting the Scene

Working in an Engineering Squad for the Melody Mars Mission, I am tasked with designing software to manage robots and cool vehicles for space exploration! Rovers navigate the Plateau so they can use their special cameras and robot arms to collect samples back to Planet Earth.

## Project Brief

The Plateau is divided into a grid. For example, "5 5", represents the width and height. A Roverâ€™s position is represented by x and y co-ordinates and the letters N, S, W, E to represent North, South, West and East. "0 0 N" means the Rover is at the bottom-left corner facing in the North direction. 

To move a Rover around the Plateau, a string of letters is sent to a Rover. 

Here are the letters and their resultant action:
 
* L - Spins the Rover 90 degrees Left without moving from the current coordinate point
* R - Spins the Rover 90 degrees Right without moving from the current coordinate point
* M - Moves the Rover forward by one grid point, maintaining the same heading (i.e. from where the Rover is facing (its orientation)). Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

Inputs into the program are given by string. A move instruction "LMLMLMLMM" would move a rover at position "1 2 N" to position "1 3 N".

## Project Setup

The solution has 2 projects. The main implementation is separated into model, interface, exception and validator. The test project has been split into mission control tests, rover tests and validator tests.

The Mission Control class takes the input as a string and allows a Plateau and Rovers to be added. It takes instructions and moves the Rovers around the Plateau.

## Project Development

The project allowed me to develop my TDD skills using AAA (Arrange, Act and Assert) and Red, Green, Refactor approach which evolved the code base for the Plateau and Rover classes. Initially there was an association between Rover and Plateau which then evolved by not having the association as it was managed by the Mission Control class. Validations also evolved which moved from Rover, then to Mission Control and finally to a separate class for validations which uses specific Exceptions based on what is being validated.

## Additional Considerations

Consideration for validation has been taken into account such as:

* Position and Plateau can not be negative.
* Can not do anything with a Rover if it is not on the Plateau.
* Rover can not be placed outside the Plateau.
* If the move instructions given to a Rover results in the Position being outside the Plateau the move is aborted.

Exceptions implemented

* PositionException
* MoveException
* PlateauException

## Updates

* Though Rovers returned from Mission Control is readonly it can be modified from outside the class. Access needs to be correctly implemented. This can be done by making objects immutable and then recreating the object with the new position.
* Position class can also be split into co-ordinates and direction.
* Plateau's that need to be different shapes rather than a square can be done by having each shape be its own shaped plateau class and each class then performs its own calculation. Introducing an interface which has to calculate the plateau would then be beneficial.
* Creating enums for directions and moves.

## Future Development

As an extension to the project I'm looking to develop this into the Mars Rover Hunger Games.

* The BattleRover would extend Rover and will be able to Dig for Mars Rocks, throw Mars Rocks to a specific position, land hits on other Rovers, limit the no of move instructions, pick up Items found on the Plateau.
* The Plateau can have hidden Items such as Super Sensors. When a Rover uses the Super Sensor it can get back information based on a certain radius, of what positions Items, Rovers and other Vehicles are at.
* Rovers can be placed at random positions.
* Can have a web based interface.


Currently we are developing this but have found that for each move the rover makes it has to check for collision and this seems like a lot of operations and a better model needs to be introduced but we can still use this for learning TDD and problem solving.

If you would like to contribute to the extension of this project and can help us to develop our TDD and pair programming skills we would love to hear from you.
